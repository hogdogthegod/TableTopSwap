# What I want to learn in this project
1. Implement Redux (or potentially react-server, but I don't understand how the CSS works)
2. Jest for unit testing (or figure out how to do tests on components / redux state-containers with mocha)
3. RequireJS / AMD.  This is basically an alternative to browserify to let you use require to use additional modules.  Instead you'd do something else that doesn't require you to take a long build process to rebuild everything every time
4. Material Design.  This project has to have big lists of stuff, so I can really imitate things like the music player.  I should make more specifically how it should look / behave ahead of time, and then actually hold myself to that design.
5. Prototyping for React components
